                <h2><b>Why am I doing this?</b></h2>
                <p>I went to a private school filled with rich kids who gets the latest tech releases every year; and I was stuck playing with lego since it was cheaper than a phone. They would sometimes make fun of me for not having an xbox, having a real phone or having watched the latest movies. </p>
                <p>Ever since I immigrated to Canada, I had the priviledge to own latest phones, watches, etc. I was excited and used them everyday of course. Fell in love with them. I started to think about how they work and why they do what they do. I started researching about how they are made and found that they are programmed, designed, and many more. It was then that I realized how dependant society is to computers and chips. It has a way of guiding everybody. Games, social media platforms, softwares for business and many more, all of playing a huge role in all our lives. </p>
                <p>That is when I chose to become a programmer. Any type of programmer. Creating websites, robotics, A.I, executable programs, everything. Just like Alexander Hamilton said in the Broadway show,"I want something to outlive me," and that is my goal. I want to create something that will be linked back to my name even after I die. A step in my goal is coming here to BCIT, to teach me everything that I need to know. I don't know what I will make or what I'll turn out to be, but I'll always have that goal. I don't care how long it takes, I am going to get it. </p>
