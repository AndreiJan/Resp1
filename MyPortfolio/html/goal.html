                <h2><b>Why am I doing this?</b></h2>
                <p>During Covid-19, 2020, I had nothing to do. I was bored and did nothing almost everyday. I played games and would always scroll through my phone. It was then that I realized how dependant we are to techonoly.<br>This eventaully led me to becoming more intersted in technology and how they work. I studied how to code and wanted to get deeper into it.</p>
                <p>I want to create something. It can be anything. I want something that will outlive me and people will keep using. I don't know what that will be, but all I know is that in BCIT, I can start somewhere here.</p>
